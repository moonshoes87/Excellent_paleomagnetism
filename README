Setup:

The directory/file_prefix is set in PmagPy_tests.py.  This must be re-set to correctly represent the directory you are using for the testing.  

Run the programs with the command:   

Troubleshooting:

If something is not working, often the WD option is set incorrectly.  If a program has the -WD option, it will run incorrectly with long file names (scripttest does not recognize relative path names). Likewise, if a program does not have the -WD option, it will run incorrectly with short file names.  

Some of the tests malfunction when other python programs are run simultaneously (notably the ones in Bootstrap_plotting.py).  It is ideal to run the tests when the computer is not otherwise in use.  (The error message that conflicting Python programs causes is usually something like: "Files not saved, file format unsupported".  The file format actually is supported, the computer just has its wires crossed.



It is possible to have problems because there are two versions of a saved document in new-test-output/.  There are some safeguards set in place to try to prevent this, but clearing that directory may be necessary at some point.  By default, the directory should self-clear when you begin a new session of testing.
