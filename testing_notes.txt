Testing maybe can be simple.  Obviously the thorough thing would be to really test every possible case, but it might be easier to just test that it returns the expected output

Keyword arguments must follow positional arguments.  I.e. parrot(1000, type="spry") works, and parrot(1000, "spry") works, but parrot(volts=1000, "spry") doesn't

All of the path names need to be long, i.e.: /Users/nebula/Python/Testing_dipole/thing

You can't import a module when you aren't in the directory where it lives.  (Not even a parent directory)


Lisa will want the output to be in a file, also you need to delete the extra test files.

    complete_zeq_magic_test()
    zeq_magic_redo.py


other, to do:
       check through the output you generate, see how helpful it is.  try to channel Lisa! # DONE....?
       go back to programs you need to fix (listed in uppercase below) DONE
       make a script that will replace all the inaccurate path names, so it can be run on a different machine.  this includes that some stdout includes -- some_file was saved in this_directory.  could put it into the strip_pmagpy function # can't really find these, but if the problem comes up, you have a great template for fixing it.... just add in to the pmagpy strip function # DONE (for now)

       a bunch of files are being told to delete that apparently don't exist.  why??  # not a problem.  this happens as a backup deletion of stuff that should be deleted at the end of the previous test.  this happens just in case the previous test wasn't fully completed.  DONE


       Measurement_import DONE
       maybe make a script for generating new, correct, and wrong files (say if Lisa "knows" a program is working but she has changed some details of the output) # started this, but it may not be practical
       check to see if there are any outfiles that are not called program_new.out.  If they don't follow the convention, they won't be deleted when they should.  
       fix find_a_program (in PT) so it doesn't come up wtih arse_measurements with I run: PmagPy_tests and input 'parse_measurements' # DONE
      use regular expressions to come up with a full list of the programs that should be involved
#       http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#regex-howto # probs DONE

       still on table:

	put all the non python programs into a separate folder so all the data type files are tucked away # makes this too messy.  
	what about removing the _new.out files if running the thing alone, maybe repeatedly? # put in a note to the console to remind someone to to do that
	go through and check command line options you didn't use. the trouble is, the options are way to many to test all possible combinations..... maybe you could just obj = env.run(options!!!), not test the results.  still, this will be irritating.  basically, it will mean going through all the programs and running -h
	use error listing to fix the broken problems
	finish readme
	go through line by line, and at least considering running full options on at least the programs that say "extra command line options".  you can also fix up any weird output.
	   	   Rename_me.py
		   Bootstrap.py
		   Extra_output.py
		   Random.py
       

fix this in Cookbook: Two out of these three links don't work -- zeq_magic.py is the only one that actually does work.  

`After you finish importing all the data, combine the individual files together with combine_magic.py and look at them with, for example, zeq_magic.py.
(see also PMM_redo.py for importing interpretations made on these files using the UCSC (Jarboe) software).


why does "weird_ani_depthplot_test" exist???
